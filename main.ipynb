    "Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-bootcamp-v4/data/main/sales.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- shop_ID: Unique identifier for each shop.\n",
    "- day_of_the_week: Encoded from 1 to 7, representing the day of the week.\n",
    "- date: Day, month, and year of the data point.\n",
    "- number_of_customers: Quantity of customers that visited the shop on that day.\n",
    "- open: Binary variable; 0 means the shop was closed, while 1 means it was open.\n",
    "- promotion: Binary variable; 0 means no promotions, 1 means there were promotions.\n",
    "- state_holiday: Encoded as 0, ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, indicating the presence of a state holiday (0 if none). ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ represent different state holidays.\n",
    "- school_holiday: Binary variable; 0 means no school holiday, 1 means there was a school holiday.\n",

    "**Deliverables**\n",
    "The Race Against Time: **Predictive Modeling Awaits** You’ll need to work quickly to build your predictive model. At 16:00, a new dataset(without target variable, you can find it here ) will be revealed, and you’ll use your model to predict sales. Get ready, collaborate with your partner, and let’s make some magic happen!\n",

    "By 17:00, predictions for the new dataset must be delivered, for you LT/TA to compare your predictions with the real label Solutions: here.\n",
