# Ironhack Kaggle 
Welcome to IronKaggle Competition: Predictive Sales Modeling Challenge!
Today’s challenge is all about using your Machine Learning skills to predict sales for various stores. 

### Dataset
Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-bootcamp-v4/data/main/sales.csv

**Metadata:**

- shop_ID: Unique identifier for each shop.
- day_of_the_week: Encoded from 1 to 7, representing the day of the week.
- date: Day, month, and year of the data point.
- number_of_customers: Quantity of customers that visited the shop on that day.
- open: Binary variable; 0 means the shop was closed, while 1 means it was open.
- promotion: Binary variable; 0 means no promotions, 1 means there were promotions.
- state_holiday: Encoded as 0, ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, indicating the presence of a state holiday (0 if none). ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ represent different state holidays.
- school_holiday: Binary variable; 0 means no school holiday, 1 means there was a school holiday.

### Deliverable
The Race Against Time: **Predictive Modeling Awaits** You’ll need to work quickly to build your predictive model. At 16:00, a new dataset(without target variable, you can find it here ) will be revealed, and you’ll use your model to predict sales. Get ready, collaborate with your partner, and let’s make some magic happen!

By 17:00, predictions for the new dataset must be delivered, for you LT/TA to compare your predictions with the real label Solutions: here.
